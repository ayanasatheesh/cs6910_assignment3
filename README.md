The repository contains the following:
1) model_vanila.ipynb notebook: where i have coded the vanila model and tested it with the best model obtained from sweep. The notebook also contains the outputs obtained . It contains the code for 1st question
2) sweep_vanila.ipynb notebook: which contains the sweep performed for vanila model along with its outputs. It contains the code for 2nd question.
3) predictions_vanila.csv file: which contains the predictions obtained from vanila model along with the actual output in hindi and input in english
4) model_with_attentions.ipynb notebook: which contains the code for attention model and i have tested it with the best model obtained from the sweep . The notebook basically contains the code for 5th question
5) attention_sweep.ipynb notebook: which contains the sweep performed for attention model along with its outputs.
6) predictions_vanila.csv file: which contains the predictions obtained from attention model along with the actual output in hindi and input in english

Instructions to train and evaluate the model:

1) For training and evaluating the vanila model please refer the cell for training on different parameters( i have provided there the best model configurations which can be changed for training and testing on a different model) in  model-vanila.ipynb notebook . The model takes hyperparameters as variables which allows to change and run different configurations for the model.
2) For perforing a different sweep please refer to sweep_vanila.ipynb notebook.
3) For training and evaluating the attention model please refer the cell for training on different parameters( i have provided there the best model configurations which can be changed for training and testing on a different model) in  model_wiith_attentions.ipynb notebook . The model takes hyperparameters as variables which allows to change and run different configurations for the model.
4) For perforing a different sweep please refer to attention_sweep.ipynb notebook.
